# Giant Pumpkin Weight Prediction with Tidymodels

This project aims to predict giant pumpkin weights using the Tidymodels framework. The main focus is on building a predictive model using a machine learning workflow.

## Files

The project directory includes the following files:

- `Predict giant pumpkin weights with tidymodels workflowsets.Rmd`: This R Markdown file contains the code and explanations for the giant pumpkin weight prediction using Tidymodels.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.
- `pumpkins.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.

## Usage

To use the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.
3. Open the `Predict giant pumpkin weights with tidymodels workflowsets.Rmd` file in RStudio.
4. Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the R Markdown file.
5. Run the code cells sequentially to execute the analysis and build the predictive model.
6. Follow the explanations and comments in the code for a better understanding of the process.
7. Modify the code or experiment with different parameters as desired.

## Dataset

The `pumpkins.csv` file contains the dataset used for this project. It includes various features related to giant pumpkins, such as their circumference, height, and weight. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the weight of a pumpkin based on these features.
